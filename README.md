# TodoApp
ReactJS browser-based desktop app with local storage.

Will be expanded upon in the future, with the following steps:

1. Transitioning into NextJS with Vercel for a full-stack application with integration. However, first I might use another backend database application like node.js
2. Backend Service - spring boot app plsu Rds
3. Multi-tenant and implement login via Google/FB/Amazon/Twitter. 
4. Add due-dates to tasks, while implementing push reminders via SMS using AWS SNS.
5. Make the UI mobile friendly.
6. Create an Andriod/iOS app that connects to the service.
7. Set up a CI/CD pipeline for the app.
8. Allow users to link accounts (for family) and allow them to create tasks for one another.
9. Integrate with Google ad services.
10. Add a paid/ad free version using PayPal/Stripe/etc
11. Make your app home page on the first page of search results.
